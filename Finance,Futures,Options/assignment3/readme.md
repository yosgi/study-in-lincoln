### Part 1: Underlying Asset Information

<!-- Explain the reasons for selecting these assets/commodities. Consider factors such as firm performance, recent price trends, prospects, and other relevant criteria. -->

1. **Johnson & Johnson**  
2. **Apple Inc.**  
3. **Tesla, Inc.**

#### 1. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
**Industry**: Healthcare  
**Volatility**: Low  
**Company Profile**: JNJ is one of the largest healthcare companies globally, with products spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. It has a steady cash flow, reliable profitability, and a long history of dividend payments. Due to the defensive nature of the healthcare sector, JNJ tends to perform more stably during market fluctuations.  
**Reason for Selection**: As a low-volatility stock, JNJ can provide stability and defensiveness to your portfolio, especially during market downturns or periods of high uncertainty. The healthcare sector typically remains resilient under such conditions.

#### 2. Apple Inc. (AAPL)
**Industry**: Technology  
**Volatility**: Moderate  
**Company Profile**: Apple is one of the largest technology companies in the world, dominating the markets for smartphones, personal computers, wearables, and digital services. Its strong brand value and vast user ecosystem give it a significant edge in technological innovation and market leadership.  
**Reason for Selection**: Recently, Apple introduced more artificial intelligence (AI) features in its newly released iPhone 16. While the device's limited local memory may not support complex AI algorithms like large language models (LLMs) and partnerships with external companies (e.g., OpenAI) might raise data privacy concerns, Apple’s control over both hardware and platform provides it with a substantial advantage. As one of the largest tech companies globally, Apple has the potential to validate AI-based monetization models. The integration of hardware and software, along with its vast user base, will support the commercialization of AI applications. Although the financial impact of AI may not yet be evident, I believe investors will soon realize its long-term value.

#### 3. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
**Volatility**: High  
**Company Profile**: Tesla is a global leader in electric vehicles and renewable energy, benefiting from the increasing demand for clean energy and smart driving technologies. Despite Tesla’s highly volatile stock price, it remains one of the most promising companies in terms of growth potential in recent years. Its innovation, technological advancements, and CEO Elon Musk’s leadership provide a strong edge in the electric vehicle and energy markets.  
**Reason for Selection**: Tesla initially planned to launch a self-driving car on August 8, but the release was delayed by two months to October 10. This caused its stock price to suffer its largest drop of the year. Although Tesla’s recent FSD V12 (Full Self-Driving) system has made significant progress in end-to-end assisted driving, many in the industry believe that there is still a substantial gap between L2-level assisted driving and L4-level full automation. It is widely anticipated that Tesla may not be able to release fully autonomous cars as scheduled in October. However, I believe that current stock prices already reflect the market's anticipation of a delay, and Tesla's potential may be underestimated, leading to high volatility in the near term.

For Tesla, a **Long Straddle** is chosen, for Apple, a **Protective Put**, and for Johnson & Johnson, a **Bull Call Spread**.

#### 1. Tesla (TSLA) - Long Straddle
**Market Outlook**: You believe Tesla’s stock price may experience significant fluctuations in the future, but you're unsure of the direction. This strategy is suitable for highly volatile stocks.  
**Strategy Description**: A long straddle involves purchasing both a call option and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy allows you to profit from significant price movements in either direction. As long as the price movement exceeds the cost of the options, you can make a profit.  
**Potential Scenarios**:
- If Tesla's stock price rises significantly, the call option will gain, while the put option's loss is limited.
- If the stock price drops significantly, the put option will gain, while the call option's loss is limited.
- If the price remains relatively stable, you may lose the cost of both options.  
**Risk and Return**:
- **Maximum Loss**: The combined cost of the call and put options.
- **Potential Return**: Unlimited, as long as the stock price moves sharply (in either direction).  
**Example**:
- You purchase a call and a put option with a strike price of $240.
- The price of each option might be $10 (depending on volatility).
- **Maximum Loss**: $20 (the total cost of both options).
- **Breakeven Points**: Upward movement beyond $260 ($240 + $20), or downward movement beyond $220 ($240 - $20).

#### 2. Apple (AAPL) - Protective Put
**Market Outlook**: You already hold Apple stock and are concerned about potential price declines. You want to protect your investment against downside risk by buying a put option.  
**Strategy Description**: You purchase a put option as insurance. If Apple’s stock price falls below the strike price, you can exercise the put option to sell your shares at the strike price, thereby limiting your losses. This strategy is commonly used to protect long-term stock investments.  
**Potential Scenarios**:
- If the stock price rises, you will only lose the cost of the option, and the stock’s gains will offset the option cost.
- If the stock price falls, the put option will protect you by allowing you to sell the shares at the strike price.  
**Risk and Return**:
- **Maximum Loss**: The cost of the put option. If the stock price rises, the option will not be exercised, but you will still benefit from the stock’s gains.
- **Potential Return**: The stock’s upside gains (if the option isn’t exercised).  
**Example**:
- Apple’s stock price is $228, and you purchase a put option with a strike price of $220.
- The cost of the option is $5.
- If the stock price drops to $220, you can exercise the put and sell at $220, limiting your losses.
- **Maximum Loss**: $5, the cost of the option.
- **Breakeven Point**: If the stock falls to $215 ($220 - $5), the option gains offset the cost.

#### 3. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Bull Call Spread
**Market Outlook**: You expect JNJ’s stock price to rise moderately, but not significantly. You want to profit from an upward movement while minimizing the cost of the options.  
**Strategy Description**: A bull call spread involves buying a call option with a lower strike price and selling a call option with a higher strike price. By selling the higher strike price call, you offset part of the cost of buying the lower strike price call, but also cap your maximum profit.  
**Potential Scenarios**:
- If JNJ’s stock price rises to the strike price of the sold call, you achieve the maximum profit (the difference between the two strike prices minus the net cost).
- If the stock price doesn’t rise or declines, you lose the cost of the bought call option, minus the income from the sold call option.  
**Risk and Return**:
- **Maximum Loss**: The cost of the bought call option minus the income from selling the higher strike call.
- **Maximum Return**: The difference between the two strike prices, minus the net cost.  
**Example**:
- JNJ’s stock price is $155, and you buy a call option with a strike price of $150 and sell a call option with a strike price of $160.
- The cost of the bought call is $5, and the income from selling the higher strike call is $2.
- **Net Cost**: $5 - $2 = $3.
- **Maximum Loss**: $3, the net cost of the options.
- **Maximum Return**: $10 (the difference between the strike prices) minus the cost, resulting in $7.
